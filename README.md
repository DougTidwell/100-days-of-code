## Day 3: May 10, 2023

Did another two sections of the [Responsive Web Design](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/2022/responsive-web-design)
course. Had no idea there were so many ways to specify colors
and gradients in CSS! 

## Day 2: May 9, 2023 

### freeCodeCamp: [Responsive Web Design](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/2022/responsive-web-design)

Spent a couple of hours going through the first two sections
of this course. A nice overview of things so far, even if 
most of this stuff I know already. (Kills me to not close
tags, but that's what the course insists on.) 

Also wrapped up the WordPress project. Or decided it was good
enough, which will have to be the same thing in this case. 

With that done, I got back to my job search....

## Day 1: May 8, 2023

### WordPress
Worked with WordPress, which was clearly created by Satan
and his minions. I've used it to edit pages on a site that someone else set up,
and that was fine; trying to set up a site from scratch (working with my sister Jude
on this) was absolutely maddening. Some things could be edited in the WP
panel, other things in the Cornerstone editor, and some things just
kind of appeared whether we wanted them to or not. Insane.

**Thoughts:** Should you take the down escalator after your death
and Satan offers either red-hot pokers applied to your flesh or
"just implement this site in WordPress and you can go," take the
seared flesh. You'll thank me.

### Der Plan

Stunned by how broken the
[freeCodeCamp](https://freecodecamp.org)
website is. Really pathetic, can't get anything to
work. At any rate, here's a list of the certifications
I want to get, although I  
may have to find them on [Udemy](https://udemy.com) instead.

* Responsive Web Design certification
* JavaScript Algorithm and Data Structures certification
* Front End Development Libraries certification
* Data Visualization certification (D3 stuff, sounds really cool)
* Back End Development and APIs certification
* Information Security certification
* Scientific Computing with Python certification
* Data Analysis with Python certification
* Machine Learning with Python certification

Would love to have the certifications for my
[LinkedIn profile](https://linkedin.com/in/doug3000), but
that may not be possible with the sorry state of Free Code Camp.
Will try it again tomorrow, maybe this is just a temporary
condition. Regardless, getting the skills is the main thing,
if I get a gold star that's a bonus.
