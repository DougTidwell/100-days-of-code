## Day 1: May 8, 2023 

### WordPress 
Worked with WordPress, which was clearly created by Satan
and his minions. I've used it to edit pages on a site that someone else set up, 
and that was fine; trying to set up a site from scratch (working with my sister Jude 
on this) was absolutely maddening. Some things could be edited in the WP 
panel, other things in the Cornerstone editor, and some things just
kind of appeared whether we wanted them to or not. Insane. 

**Thoughts:** Should you take the down escalator after your death
and Satan offers either red-hot pokers applied to your flesh or 
"just implement this site in WordPress and you can go," take the 
seared flesh. You'll thank me.
